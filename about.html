            This is where you can find information about me, Matthew!
    <h2> Who am I? </h2>
    Well to start off with my name is Matthew, and I am a freshman at <a href="https://www.uri.edu/">URI</a>. <br>
            I am studying Mathematics and Computer Science, and intending to major in both! I graduated EGHS in the spring of 2021. <br>
           Over the summer I worked at <a href="https://www.oceanstatejoblot.com/">Ocean State Job Lot</a>, as a Sales Associate. <br> <br>
            I have two cats, named Meezer and Penny, who are both siameze rescues. During my free time I enjoy playing video games, reading, and hanging out with friends!
